#Trello Random Task Selector
This tools is meant to randomly select an arbitrary number of tasks from a Trello board of your choice, and then email those task names to you.  It is intended to be run on a cron.  It expects a file in the same directory named `config.json`, however you can pass it a full or relative path as the first commandline argument.
